## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

The data set is from 2011-2012.
canditates = Candidate Master File
committees = Committee Master File
contributions = Contributions to Candidates (and other expenditures) from committees

idea

- is there a relaitonship between amount of contribution and being elected?

- which contributor is contributing the most? and is there a contributor which tends to contribute to the winner? and the relation with the transaction type ==> use candidate ids to link to the candidates  

- How different are men and women candidates in general? the amount of contribution, the amount of voting, and the rate of being elected
